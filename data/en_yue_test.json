In this way, a lot of manufacturing industries have moved to the mainland. In this way, it is necessary to make this manufacturing industry fundamentally good, good, good is that the position is rarely won. Vacancies rarely win. And what about those people in Hong Kong, those employers at all, there is so much competition now. The products he makes are so competitive. Aren't they just not affordable to hire a Hong Kong worker at such a wage? I think that's the main reason. But it's impossible for a worker in Hong Kong to accept such a low wage for a part-time job. Because why? Hong Kong's living index is so high. If you are given 8,000 yuan a month for a worker, it is already very tense and naughty. But what about foreign workers?

Some event organizers use the word \"Canton\" to refer to Guangdong, such as \"Art Canton\" and \"Canton Asian Music Festival\". The non-governmental organization Guangzhou Fan League uses Canton FC as the English name of Guangzhou Evergrande Football Club, which is supported by Qudi. Some committee members suggested naming the Canton Tower as Uranium Canton Tower, so as to make full use of the internationally renowned brand of Uranium Canton and unify the city logo, and the English name of the Canton Tower is Uranium Canton Tower, which is the first time that the authorities have used Canton back since 1979. Although the Canton Tower is owned by the government, it is not a government department, so there is some space in the English naming, and it will not be subject to some mainland regulations.",
    "tgt": "呢幾年，傳統稱謂開始多返地方用，半官方機構主辦啲活動，如廣府文化節，就翻譯成“Canton Festival”。有啲活動舉辦方就用“Canton”來表示廣東，好似藝術廣東國際收藏品及藝術品博覽會嘅英文名係“Art Canton”，廣東亞洲音樂節英文名係“Canton Asian Music Festival”。民間團體廣州球迷聯盟係用Canton FC，作為渠地支持嘅廣州恒大足球俱樂部嘅英文名。有委員建議咗將廣州塔命名成“Canton Tower”，以充分利用“Canton”呢個國際知名品牌，統一城市標識，最尾廣州塔英文定名係“Canton Tower”，呢個係1979年以來當局首次用返Canton。雖然廣州塔係政府所有，不過唔係政府單位部門，所以英文命名度有返啲空間，唔會畀啲大陸法規約束。"

Guo Taiming also firmly believes in Guan Shengdi Jun (Guan Dijun, Guan Di, Guan Gong), and worships the statue of Emperor Guan in the Tucheng headquarters of Hon Hai, and personally went to the Guandi Temple in Jiezhou, Shanxi Province to welcome the statue of Emperor Guan's soft body to Taiwan. Guo Taiming once encountered Hu Zongxian's bomb case, but the explosive materials were not ignited, and there was a false alarm. Guo Taiming said that the bomb did not explode, and it was the Guan Sheng Emperor who showed his spirit. During the 2014 Sunflower Student Movement, Guo Taiming claimed to have been instructed by Guan Gong to coordinate the exit of the student movement. On April 17, 2019, Guo Taiming went to Banqiao Cihui Palace and Tamsui Wusheng Palace to pay homage and ask whether he wanted to participate in the 2020 presidential election of The President of the Republic of China; Guo Taiming said that Mazu had a dream a few days ago to make him come out to do good deeds for the suffering people and bring peace and prosperity to Taiwan, and he will definitely follow Mazu's instructions.",

Voiced or voiced refers to nasal and flowing voices. In the first column from the right of the belly, tongue, teeth, and teeth in the \"Rhyme Mirror\", the superscript \"clear\" is an unaspirated stopper, that is, completely clear. In the third column from the right, the superscript \"voiced\" is voiced stop, that is, voiced. The first column of the right genus of the guttural bar is polyphonic – which can also be understood as a guttural stop. The other columns with the single \"clear\" or \"voiced\" characters are fricatives in the same part of the column. The phonemes of the \"voiced\" counterpoint of the guttural sound are Yu 3 and Yu 4 of the Middle Initials, and the actual sound value is controversial. The right and left sides of the \"tongue teeth\" correspond to the \"half tongue\" and \"half teeth\" in the 36 letters, respectively.",

It states that even if the above three conditions are met, it is still not possible to say \"S knows P\" in some cases. In response to this situation, Robert · Nozick proposed uranium truth tracking uranium, arguing that as long as the significance of the investigation is reasonably explained, the rebuttal of Gettier can be resolved. He retains the first two conditions of the original JTB theory, and then changes the third \"confirmation\" condition to \"If P is not true, S does not believe P, and if P is true, S believes P\".",

Then I'm going to go to the hospital. That's, shhh But he began to claim compensation from this bus company, so he had to pay - naughty, and claimed 450,000 yuan. This is OK, if you say that it is a physical injury. But he had a special reason for making a claim. That is to say, he can't—it's just that since the accident, he's lost the ability to communicate with this spirit world. It's just that he can't carry out his mission anymore is God, naughty, and naughty. He was ten years ago, and he got a special ability. That's what these gods do. In this way, since then, there has been a kind of ability to unsign with others, exorcism, and even god fighting, and ask God to come up. So he went to do some psychic work with some of the neighbors. Ever since I crashed the car, it's terrible, it's hard to ride the heaven and earth line. No matter how much you shout, you can't do business. This would require a claim of 450,000 in the case. So what do you say is that if a lawsuit comes up, how do you say a judge? How do you find a reason to come out?",

After the Albuba Rebellion was pacified during the Yongzheng period, the government affairs of Tibet, which was ordered by the Qing court, were restricted by the minister stationed in Tibet. During his time in power, the authorities described him as \"loyal and honest\", and he was trusted by the imperial court. In the fourth year of Qianlong (1739), because of his meritorious efforts in recruiting and pacifying the armistice of the three tribes of Baleb (now the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal), Po Luo Nai was made the king of Doro County, becoming the most powerful Tibetan prince in the Qing Dynasty. In the twelfth year of Qianlong (1747), Po Luo Nai died of illness, and the imperial court appointed his second child, Zhurmat Namzal, to inherit the prince of the county, and at the same time take care of the affairs of Lun. Zhurmat Namzale \"never believed in the Dalai Lama and harbored a grudge\", ostensibly obeying the minister stationed in Tibet, but secretly contacted the Dzungar Ministry of Mongolia and waited for the opportunity to send troops to rebel. In the 14th year of Qianlong (1749), Zhurmat Namzal killed his eldest brother Zhurmat Tsebuden and took control of Ali. In the fifteenth year of Qianlong (1750), Fu Qing and Labdun, the ministers stationed in Tibet, booby-trapped Zhurmat Namzal because of the situation, and Zhuo Nar (official name) of the same faction as him killed the two ministers stationed in Tibet. Then the Qing court sent the governor of Sichuan, Celeng, to lead troops into Tibet to quell the rebellion.",

    "src": "Few of Leung's early works are known, and even if they were published, they were not available in all major bookstores, and no one cared about them at the book signing sessions at the Hong Kong Book Fair. Later, he noticed the problem and began to seriously run his fan page, which attracted nearly 90,000 netizens in just two years. His 2016 serialized novel \"I'm Gi'an, Today I'm at Nobita's Funeral\" made him even more famous, with more than 150,000 likes and more than 30,000 shares in one day, and his 2018 work \"Onomatopoeia of Death\" also received about 1 million views after being serialized on the Internet for about 10 days.",
    "tgt": "梁早期嘅作品無乜人知，就算出版書籍亦都未能喺各大書局全線上架，喺香港書展嘅簽書會亦都無人問津。後嚟佢留意到問題所在，就開始認真經營自己嘅粉絲專頁，喺短短兩年間就吸引到近9萬名網民支持。而喺2016年連載嘅小說《我是技安，今天我出席了大雄的葬禮》更加令佢出名，有關嘅帖喺一日內獲得超過15萬個Like，分享次數過3萬；2018年推出嘅作品《死亡的擬聲詞》喺網絡連載約十日後亦都獲得約一百萬嘅點擊次數。"
