In addition, all four words except \"ござる\" have been changed to \"~い\". Therefore, these five words are sometimes referred to as the ラ行 of modern Chinese, and the verbs are particularly used. Although \"御座る (ござる)\" comes from \"ござ\" + \"あり\", and \"おっしゃnaughty\" comes from \"仰せ\" + \"あり\", in contrast to the characteristics of the use of the ancient text ラ行変格 in which the termination of the form is the same as the form of the same form, the special feature of the use of the ラ行 is that the form of the command is the same form. This indicates that these words are not used in ancient texts.",

In the 21st century, with the opening of Hong Kong to free travel, there are still many Hong Kong-funded enterprises back to Guangzhou to open a branch (such as Xu Liushan umbrella Hui Lau Shan uranium), Guangzhou people have deepened their understanding of Hong Kong's retention of Cantonese spelling, and the Hong Kong government's preservation and inheritance of Cantonese culture has inspired Hui Guangzhou people to be dissatisfied with the mainland government's forced popularization and stifling local culture. However, some people in Guangzhou, after not knowing some of the history of Cantonese pinyin, think that some pinyin was invented in Hong Kong, so they call it Lin Hong Kong Pinyin uranium. In 2010, the Hong Kong government's Hing Shing Road was used for many media interviews, and many citizens supported it at that time. Subsequently, the Guangzhou Urban Construction Committee immediately changed the English of the sign to Mandarin Pinyin on the grounds that the canal violated the local standard of Guangdong Province \"Specification for the English Translation of Public Signs\".",

The ancestors of European historiography were Thucydides, Herodotus, and the historiography of the Catholic Church. Europe, after the Age of Enlightenment, emphasized rational thinking, such as in the time of Voltaire-Louis XIV. Prussian Ranke wrote history from linguistic, folklore surveys and the use of government archives, and Ranke read extensively the official archives of Prussia and Italy and the national language of Serbia, all of which were valued at the time. The research content and research topics of twentieth-century history have been expanded to include socio-economic issues, such as the Annals School, Public History, and Oral History.",

Clad in blood, he is a veritable god of war, but he died under the sword of the monarch he guarded, just to keep his promise to the previous king. During this 939 years, he lived as a ghost, like a sword in his heart, and the vicious and romantic curse \"You can only pull this sword out if you meet a ghost bride\". One day when he continues this immortal life, he meets Chi Ting, a 19-year-old girl who claims to be the ghost bride. In other words, listening to scolding is the only weapon that can kill oneself. In the whole play, Lee Dong Wook Wang Li is in his 300s, a messenger of the underworld, and he was the king of Goryeo to whom Kim Shin was loyal during his lifetime. The death of every man is a covenant with him. He lives with the ghost Kim Shin, and often feels the limits of his heart in Kim Shin's changeable emotions and impermanence. As soon as he opened his eyes after his death, he had already become a messenger of the underworld, and he had forgotten all about the past, and all he knew was countless dead souls. But one day, he meets a woman, Sunny, and feels dizzy and in a mood that he hasn't seen for a long time. After completing the mission of the messenger of the underworld, he was reincarnated as Li He, a criminal policeman of the Serious Crime Team of the Gangnam Police Department, and fell in love with the reincarnated Kim Sun again. Kim Min-jae (special starring) A young monarch in the Goryeo era, after the collapse of his father and the death of his humble mother, he was single-handedly pulled by Park Huanheon, the superintendent of the country, and listened to his slanderous rumors to make him jealous of the military general Kim Shin, who was regarded as a god by the people, and worried about his high merits, and gave Kim Shin to death for the felony of treason. Yu Hou survived in the longing for Kim Sun, and deliberately drank the poisonous decoction presented by Park Joong Heon in order to find relief. 1, 7-13 Kim Go-eun (Childhood: Han Shuzhen (Korean: Naughty (2008) ) Chi Ting's scolding is 19 years old, an ordinary senior high school candidate. Before he was born, he and his mother died in a car accident, but he was rescued by Jin Shin and resurrected, and since then he has been recognized as \"other missing ones\" by the messengers of the underworld. Since childhood, I can see the souls of the dead that ordinary people can't see, so I go alone. In a hodgepodge of speechless life, she meets a ghost, and her fate is to become the bride of the ghost. Ghosts always appear after the candles are blown out, and curiosity gradually becomes a habit, and waiting for ghosts is like waiting for a better future. After being killed in a car accident, she was reincarnated as a high school girl Park So-min with her memories and returned to Canada to reunite with Kim Shin. The whole drama Yoo In-na Sunny (Kim Sun) is 28 years old, an orphan, the owner of a fried chicken restaurant, and in her previous life, Kim Shin's sister and Queen Kim Sun of Goryeo. Early on I realized that the most comfortable thing in the world is an ignorant woman, a man's appearance is the window of the soul, and true love is felt through a passbook, for Sunny, who is about to be 30 years old, becoming someone's first love is the easiest thing in the world. When she first saw the messenger of the underworld when she found the ring she wanted to have, she at first thought he was a good-looking fool, and even if sympathy was not her specialty, the sad look in his eyes was always heart-wrenching. After 68 years of life, she was reincarnated as an actress and fell in love with the reincarnated Wang Li again. 2-16 Kim So-hyun (special starring) The queen of the Goryeo era and the younger sister of Kim Shin, who did not want to see his brother die after Wang Li was subject to Park Joong-heon because of himself, and chose to die under the king's arrows. 1, 7-12 Lu Xingcai (Childhood: Jung Ji-hoon (Korean: Naughty (2007년) ) (Youth: Kim Hyun-bin (Korean: Naughty)) Andy Lau is 25 years old, the third chaebol, the thirteenth-generation only son of the family that serves ghosts. The Yoo family's gradual growth from a gold and silver shop on the outskirts of Hanyang to a large business is also due to the ghosts, and the next generation will be served by Teokhua. At first, he chose to resist, and after realizing for the first time the fact that the ghosts had been separated again and again, and no matter how painful it was, he could only stagnation alone in the world, and from that day on, Dehua made up his mind: from now on, the assistant will start now. Because of his kind and simple nature, he was chosen by the Seven Star God and attached to him, and his consciousness will be replaced when necessary, and he is the driving force behind all events in secret.

If you roll 6, you can choose a non-starting piece to be placed at the starting position instead of moving the starting piece. If you roll a 6, you can roll the dice one more time. If the third roll reaches a 6, that action is void and it is the next player's turn. Any piece can be passed through on the way. If you hit another player's piece, you can kick the enemy's piece back into the area where there is no starting point, and you can roll the dice again. To reach the finish line, you must roll just the right number of points to succeed. Every time a move reaches the end, you can roll the dice again. The first to reach the end of all his pieces is the winner.",

Originally, it referred to an animal that was trained to carry objects on its back or ride on a human (see Animal Transport). In the culture of the Internet in Chinese mainland, licking a dog means a person who shushes the object of affection in response to warmth, that is, kneels and licks others like a dog. In Hong Kong, these men are also called spare tires (like the attendants under the Guanyin throne are sent by Xiao Xian). The word \"spare tire\" has a long history, and is used in Hong Kong slang to describe the desperate fact that some man does anything for a woman in order to pursue her. Later, the term was extended to virtual communities such as Internet forums. The women who are worshipped are called Guanyin, Niangniang or Goddess, which is derived from the word \"spare tire\". In Taiwan's online culture, the recipient of the offering is usually called a princess or goddess than others, and the devotee is often referred to as a volcano filial son or knight.",

Sima Qian, one of the founders of Chinese history, proposed that \"when studying heaven and man, the changes of the past and the present, become the words of a family\" as the research goal of historiography. Historians will study the successes and failures of ancient political reforms in order to solve the shortcomings of today's political reforms, rather than studying an issue that has nothing to do with modern life for no reason. Historiography is not about accumulating knowledge for the sake of accumulating knowledge; However, in the late 20th century, with the rise of microhistory and cultural history, the traditional view of history was challenged. Emerging schools of \"post-learning\" such as feminism and queer theory have criticized the close ties between traditional historiography and the ruling elites of society, pointing out that the current direction of research ignores marginalized groups and underprivileges.",

With the passage of time, the evolution of phonetics, the more the door method was written, and finally in the Ming and Qing dynasties, the door method attached to the rhyme map could be more than a dozen, not only did not make the rhyme diagram simpler, but made the rhyme map become a \"book from heaven\".",

But from the long and unclear description of her problem, Liang Xiangyi couldn't help but roll her eyes many times one after another, expressing her dissatisfaction with Zhang Huijun. The whole process was broadcast live by China Central Television, and at 12 o'clock the news spread throughout the Chinese Internet. Screenshots of WeChat chat records circulating on social media show that Liang Xiangyi said to a friend after learning that she rolled her eyes and was broadcast live: \"Worry about her virtue, ask more questions than answers.\" The two of them happened to be dressed in red and blue at the time, and the comparison became a hot topic on the Internet, and articles about the two appeared in various online media, especially on WeChat public accounts. Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the Global Times, posted on Weibo and said: Lin Yicai, a female reporter from the first financial network, Liang Xiangyi is on fire. She rolled her eyes at the reporter next to her who asked a lengthy question, and was broadcast live on TV, laughing at netizens. I hope that such tidbits can stay on the Internet and not be deleted. Ordinary people just like this kind of thing, and this DNA of human nature can't be changed. Party members and cadres should talk about politics at any time, but ordinary people don't. Ordinary people also like to look at the perspective of politics, but it doesn't hurt.
